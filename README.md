### 2. Overall Description

**2.1 Product Perspective**

SafeBond is developed as a standalone system that operates independently to provide seamless communication, health monitoring, and emergency alert functionalities. While the platform is self-sufficient in delivering its core features, it integrates with a few external services to enhance its overall capabilities:

- Mobile Platforms: SafeBond is primarily designed for Android and iOS mobile devices. The mobile app serves as the primary interface for users to communicate, monitor health, and manage emergencies.
- Desktop Platforms: A desktop version of the SafeBond app will be available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, providing extended accessibility to users across multiple devices. The desktop version offers similar features as the mobile app.
- Web Access: While the web interface has limited functionality, it will allow users to briefly access their accounts for signing in/out and generate a barcode for easy mobile app installation. It acts as a supporting interface rather than a fully functional platform.
- Health Monitoring APIs: SafeBond integrates with external APIs to track users' vital signs such as heart rate, enabling real-time health monitoring. These APIs connect with wearable devices or other healthcare systems, ensuring accurate and continuous data flow.
- Location Services: The system relies on GPS-based location services to track users’ movements. This information is critical in emergencies, helping family members, friends, and healthcare staff locate users swiftly and accurately.
- Emergency Response: SafeBond links with nearby hospitals and emergency services based on the user's location. In health crises, the platform notifies the nearest hospitals, providing essential information like the user's location and health status to ensure timely medical intervention.

By leveraging mobile, desktop, and web platforms, along with health monitoring and location tracking services, SafeBond creates a comprehensive, all-in-one solution to ensure the safety and well-being of its users.
