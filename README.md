# SafeBond

**Objective:**
SafeBond aims to develop a comprehensive platform enabling individuals in workplaces or healthcare facilities to maintain real-time communication with their families via chat and video functionalities. The platform will also incorporate health monitoring features, including tracking vital signs such as heart rates. In the event of a health emergency, such as a significant drop in vital signs, the application will automatically call designated family members with an automated message, informing them of the situation and the individual’s location to enable swift assistance.
